    "## BUSINESS GOAL DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "My client is a businessman who spends a lot of time travelling. One of his future business trips will be a long-term stay in New York. Apart from many expected hours sitting at the office my client wants also to stay in a good physical shape, so he wants me to analyze and recommend the best part of New York according to the density of fitness centers, gyms, martial arts dojos and similar facilities. My client doesnâ€™t mind the accommodation, the priority is to have good gyms and/or fitness centers within reach."
